🔀 Branch Structure

All design work and XML UI files are created in a separate design branch.

Once completed and tested, the design is merged into the master branch for final use.

The master branch contains the working version of the app with both UI and Kotlin code integrated.

Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CineSwift.git
Replace YourUsername with your GitHub username.

After cloning, open a terminal in the project folder:

bash
git checkout master
Open the Project in Android Studio

Open Android Studio

Choose "Open an existing project"
